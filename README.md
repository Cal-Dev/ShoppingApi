# ShoppingApi
working through .NET Core book projects

this shopping api is a simple .NET Core 2.0 API to interface with an Angular front end shopping cart. 

the shoping cart front end was initally built using angular cli , and then migrated to one .NET core project 

so it could live in one single application.
